            <i>The museogrophical history and organization of the National Museum at Belgrade were described very fully in</i> Museum <i>twenty‐six years ago (‘Reorganization of the National Museum, Belgrade’, by Djordje Mano‐Zissi</i>, Museum, Vol. VIII, No. 1, 1955, pp. 50–63) The details of this custodian of the material culture and art of the Serbian nation have not changed. Nevertheless, we requested Desanka MiloŠević to complete her preceding article with a brief overview of the museum's collections as they are today, and of the conservation, excavation and popularization activities with which they are interlinked.</p>

        <p>Lepcnski Vir is a prehistoric village site about 7,000 years old, discovered in 1965 during earthworks for the Djerdap dam and excavated by a team of archaeologists under the direction of Professor Dragoslav Srejović of the University of Belgrade. Eighty‐five dwellings were discovered, the first examples in this part of Europe of a clear and definite architectural conception, together with numerous sculptures, which are displayed in the site museum. Threatened with submersion by the rising waters, the village of Lepenski Vir, like Abu Simbel, was transferred to higher ground, where the houses were reconstructed after thorough conservation treatment under the direction of Milka Canak‐Medić and Milorad Medic, Head of the National Museum's Conservation Department.—Ed.</p>

        <p>Lepcnski Vir is a prehistoric village site about 7,000 years old, discovered in 1965 during earthworks for the Djerdap dam and excavated by a team of archaeologists under the direction of Professor Dragoslav Srejović of the University of Belgrade. Eighty‐five dwellings were discovered, the first examples in this part of Europe of a clear and definite architectural conception, together with numerous sculptures, which are displayed in the site museum. Threatened with submersion by the rising waters, the village of Lepenski Vir, like Abu Simbel, was transferred to higher ground, where the houses were reconstructed after thorough conservation treatment under the direction of Milka Canak‐Medić and Milorad Medic, Head of the National Museum's Conservation Department.—Ed.</p>
